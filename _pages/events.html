        <p>
          Our "community night" events are a new part of our brigade schedule in 2019. We use this time to
          onboard new volunteers looking to get involved with leadership opportunities or be an ambassador with our
          community partners. Some nights we might have guest speakers (weâ€™ll update the agenda if there is one). 
          Our leadership team also holds a meeting later in the night to plan plan our future Brigade events, communications,
          and direction.

          These are the traditional "hack night" sessions we've been holding since the brigade's inception. 
          Here our brigade volunteers generally break out into teams and work on their respective projects in-person.
          You will have the opportunity to learn more about what we do through a quick orientation, get connected to a 
          project, discuss how to start your own project, or connect with our leadership team.

        <p>
          Come socialize with other members of Open Charlotte Brigade, meet some new people, 
          and learn about leadership opportunities! This is a casual, quarterly event series
          allowing attendees to unwind and get to know the people they're working with.
          Just show up, grab a name tag, and join a conversation!

        <p>
          Hack for Change is a big one day civic design-a-thon Open Charlotte holds to celebrate National Day of 
          Civic Hacking. On this day, organizations all over the nation bring together community members and civic 
          leaders to work with our local governments and tackle some our toughest challenges. 
          We'll have more details on our 2019 event later this year!
