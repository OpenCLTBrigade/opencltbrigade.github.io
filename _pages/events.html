        <h2>Community Nights</h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>
          Our "community night" events are a new part of our brigade schedule in 2019. We use this time to
          onboard new volunteers looking to get involved with leadership opportunities or be an ambassador with our
          community partners. Some nights we might have guest speakers (we’ll update the agenda if there is one). 
          Our leadership team also holds a meeting later in the night to plan our future Brigade events, communications,
          and direction.

        <p>
          These are the traditional "hack night" sessions we've been holding since the brigade's inception. 
          Here our brigade volunteers generally break out into teams and work on their respective projects in-person.
          You will have the opportunity to learn more about what we do through a quick orientation, get connected to a 
          project, discuss how to start your own project, or connect with our leadership team.

        <p>
          The Open NC Collaborative is a brigade composed of volunteers and leaders from the North Carolina Code for 
          America Brigades including Open Charlotte Brigade. Each year we meet in person to celebrate our successes
          and discuss our shared vision and goals for the upcoming year. We also hold occasional remote meetings to
          collaborate on projects throughout the year. The best way to get involved in these is to reach out to Open 
          Charlotte's leadership team members at the next brigade event!
