<p>
  Open Charlotte Brigade, started in 2014 as "Code for Charlotte," 
  is a volunteer citizen brigade that uses technology and advocacy as a tool for open government, open data and 
  civic engagement. When we see an opportunity to solve a problem or make services more accessible we work with 
  community members and government partners to build the right tool or ensure the proper data is available.

  Open Charlotte Brigade is part of the Code for America Brigade Network. We share in our efforts with over
  seventy other brigades located throughout the United States. Brigade members routinely meet both online and
  in-person to tackle large challenges together, use technology to respond to crises throughout the country, 
  and simply improve upon their own brigade's practices.
