          Open Charlotte Brigade is a volunteer-driven organization and we invite anyone to help us grow the civic tech
          movement or help steer our efforts in doing so.
          Our core leadership team is made up of volunteers who are the most familiar and engaged in driving individual 
          areas of our brigade.

          The best way to get involved in brigade leadership is by attending one of our leadership meetings which are generally
          held during the second half of our <a href="/events">community nights</a>. You can view the notes from past leadership
          meetings for 2019 <a href="/notes">here</a>.
